This font was made by printing out a couple pages full 
of impact letters, folding up the paper and 
putting them in my back pocket for the day. Not having 
a scanner at the time, I took pics of each page, 
traced them in Illustrator, and used fontlab for the 
creation of the font itself.  

Thanks!
Kenny
